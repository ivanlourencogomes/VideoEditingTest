# Welcome to the video editing test

## 1. Attached files

Attached to this repo you will find a few example files (Example #1) to understand how is our process of editing our video lessons.

## 2. What we expect

The job you have to do is editing Example #2 and providing a single final mp4 video.

We expect you to remove all gaps, mistakes made on speech or on coding and any other things you
consider to be important to generate a clean final video. Just don't remove the silent parts where code is being written.

Audio enhancement is not required on this first test. If you get hired we will provide you a step-by-step guide to use our scripts to improve audio. Our script automatically reduces the sound of breathing and background noise.

We would like you to provide a final mp4 video with the Intro we provided and a fade to black at the end.

Please upload your final video file to Wetransfer, Dropbox or Google Drive and share the link to dawebschools@gmail.com.

Thank you!

Ivan Gomes.
